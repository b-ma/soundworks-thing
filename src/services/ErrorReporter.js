/**
 * Interface for the client `'error-reporter'` service.
 *
 * This service allows to log javascript errors that could occur during the
 * application life cycle. Errors are caught and sent to the server in order
 * to be persisted in a file.
 * By default, the log files are located in the `logs/clients` directory inside
 * the application directory.
 *
 * *The service is automatically launched whenever the application detects the
 * use of a networked activity. It should never be required manually inside
 * an application.*
 *
 * __*The service must be used with its [server-side counterpart]{@link module:soundworks/server.ErrorReporter}*__
 *
 * @memberof module:soundworks/client
